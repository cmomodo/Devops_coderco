This is level 11.

```
mkdir One1
```
we create a folder first

Next we will look for the command to monitor disk usage.
```
df -h
```
We manually put it in and see if it works.

Next we will now put this in a script.

To make sure everything is printed. we pipe it to `aws`.

```
awk '{print5%}

```

Next we pipe it to tr command to translate and delete characters.

```
tr -d ' '

```
