For the first level.

I used my own knowledge which is:

mkdir level1 touch archer.txt image.txt warrior.txt

after looking at it online. i found out the solution was to use the ` && ` command to create multiple files at once. it waits till the first command is executed before executing the second command.

The correct command is `mkdir Arena && cd Arena && touch archer.txt image.txt warrior.txt`
