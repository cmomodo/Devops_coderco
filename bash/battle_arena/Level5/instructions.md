This level we first create a new directory called "Battlefield".

```
mkdir Battlefield

```

Next we will create files in this directory.

```
touch Battlefield/file1.txt

```

Next we will then create a file in another directory if it doesnt exist.

```
mkdir -p AnotherDirectory
touch AnotherDirectory/file2.txt

```

To validate everything we will list it all.

```
ls folder_name
```
